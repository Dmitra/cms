"no name" concept

Everybody got accustomed to the concept of creating the file and giving
it a name.
But recall your many "New folder(X)" named by default when you haven't
come up with an idea how to name it, but you already have to
store something in it!

Each node has the meaning. Name (title) - short way to introduce the
content. It may be a suitable way to be found by. Thus the name
becomes the separate node itself.
