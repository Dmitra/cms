Principles
----------

- General-purpose graph/network data editing software.
- Human brain associative thinking.
- Proficient User eXperience.

Graph
-----

| The memory of the system is a graph.
| There are only two main features to store content in Graphiy KMS.
| Item and it's relations are links.

*This makes SIMPLICITY.*

Item
-----------------------
(Element / Unit / Node)

Every piece of information is an Item just like our thoughts or memory.
It may be anything: just a word, number, date, url, or a bigger chunk of
text, separate file or even binary data: image, video.

*This makes UNIVERSALITY.*

Item can be assigned with own value. A user just puts it in by editing.
It is the same like human perceptual piece of memory - a pattern
obtained with perception we possess (visual, auditory). Computer will
perfectly store the value unlike rough human memory.

Item may have no own value and be a complex derivative formed by linking
to others.

Link
------------------------------
(Relation / Connection / Edge)

| Item to item relationship.
| Works like human brain association. It has neither direction nor
  metadata. It is just a notion of item to item relatedness.

Two items relatedness extent is defined by link weight. Same as human
brain associations have weight storing the "how much" two things are
related.

*This makes POWER.*

Itemtype
--------

It is a set of rules which define complex information.
