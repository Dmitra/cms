About
===========================

Summary
~~~~~~~
Graphiy KMS is a productivity software made to manage high volume of
highly connected information effectively.

Basically, Graphiy provides only a single feature. And that is ACCESS.
Access to the information in a natural ASSOCIATIVE way.

The idea is to let you handle data as thoughts in mind.
Make things accessible even without search.
Integrate knowledge across different services and give intuitive
mind-map like interactive interface.
Ideally, augment your memory and compensate forgetting.

Problem
~~~~~~~

Researchers, analysts, managers face the problem of instantly growing
amount of information every day. We use different services for different
purposes which leads to little knowledge aggregation or its absence. We
mustn’t miss the important and the new, we need to have the topical on
hand and we want to easily access the sought-for. All kinds of
information are involved: mails, contacts, notes, photos, messages, etc.
People use each service for different purpose and encounter loss,
duplication, outdate and even false data. This gives team work a hard
time.

Solution
~~~~~~~~

1. Reinforced search
  Graphiy integrates user’s services and tracks connections between
  data used. This gives user an ability to reveal their knowledge by
  associations. Usually, 2-5 related things are enough to find any
  context. This makes classic full-text search redundant.
2. Automatic mind-map interface.
  Many of you used mind-managers and many did it only for a single map.
  It is good to see the big picture but it’s extra work to build and
  sync it. Graphiy provides access to live data, thus giving you
  mind-map interface for free.
3. Benefit of knowledge not a raw data.
  MS Office file, online document, email, photo might have the
  information about same thing. Usually you collect that bit by bit
  from different sources, while you would like to see it as a single
  entity. That is exactly what Graphiy does.
