Human brain companion.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Knowledge is the most important asset for an individual as well as for
an organization.
We are creating a system that stores information in the same way it is
done in a human brain. It allows us to literally expand our
opportunities. An unreliable nature of human memory can be fully
compensated by computer (hopefully). Furthermore, a collective memory use creates
conditions to build a uniquely smart teams and organizations.

Basically, Graphiy provides only one feature. And that is access. Access
to the information. While it may sound unreasonable, as long as we can
easily access any information with all our services in hand. That's
particularly true for the recent information. But people tend to forget
things over time. This doesn't happen as a complete loss of something.
Human memory is based on neuron network. It stores data with only some
degree of accuracy fading with time. That's why we instantly need to
search over and over again. And here comes the most in-demand features
in every single application and data source - **search**.


Basis for Artificial Intelligence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Information stored in graph along with knowledge processor aka *semantic
reasoner* may constitute a good candidate for Artificial Intelligence in
future.
